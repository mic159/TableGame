This is my game system that uses 4 LED matrix HT1632 modules to form the screen and two PS2 controllers for input.

The HT1632 library was modified to support my layout, and the fork lives here: https://github.com/mic159/HT1632

The PS2 library is here: https://github.com/madsci1016/Arduino-PS2X

The pins are:
Arduino     Display
  2     ->   DATA (on all HT1632 chips)
  3     ->   WR (on all HT1632 chips)
  4     ->   CS on chip 1
  5     ->   CS on chip 2
  6     ->   CS on chip 3
  7     ->   CS on chip 4

Arduino     PS2
  9     ->   CLK (on both controllers)
  10    ->   DAT (on both controllers)
  11    ->   CMD (on both controllers)
  12    ->   CS on controller 1
  13    ->   CS on controller 2
